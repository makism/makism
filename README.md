### Hi there 👋, it's me, Makis!

```
I've recently fell in love with mechanical keyboards.
Currently I operate an Anne Pro 2 and the Granite keyset, designed by matt3o.
Also, according to my wife, I'm addicted to MOOCS — but I just enjoy learning! 🤷‍♂️
```

I am a SWE & R&D (and data-curious) at [Brain Innovation B.V.](https://www.brainvoyager.com) in Maastricht, The Netherlands. At the same time I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Cognitive Neuroscience Department, in Maastricht University.

Expert in Python, C++/Qt, and delving into DE/MLE and Real-Time Data Analytics. My research interests include Brain Connectivity (functional) & Graph Theory. Also, I'm a Golang aficionado, and I'm reminiscencing my Java skills!

Oh, that's also me:<br/>
