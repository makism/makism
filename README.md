## Hey there 👋, I'm Makis!

> If I were to name a favourite book, that would be Gibson's "Neuromancer"; hackers jacking into cyberspace by projecting their consciousness into a shared virtual space, a hidden layer augmenting the perceived reality. That was cyberpunk at its most refined form; brains interfacing with computers and enhanced cognitive capabilities. Now I am positioned to realize the blur between science fiction and reality. Ideas and notions that were previously thought to be science fiction are becoming a reality, and that is something that overwhelms me.

> Quoting Gibson, "My problem is that all things are increasingly attractive to me, " describes my engagement with computer science and neuroscience, studying the brain's cognition under different tasks, mental loads and even neurodegenerative diseases. More specifically, I am interested in investigating the connectivity between brain regions and studying graph theoretical analyses to explain these established networks. My most recent academic and professional choices are pivoted around these topics.

My professional skills and interests include<br />
🐍 Python/C++<br />
❄️ DE (Spark) and ML (Tensorflow)<br />
🍄 Graph Theory<br />

Currently, I'm learning<br />
🎯 Scala for FP<br />
🌊 Apache Kafka, Flink & Beam for Data Streaming<br/>
※ neo4j<br />
※ Julia<br/>

Academic background<br />
※ PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University; focused on Brain Connectivity (functional) & Network Neuroscience

<br />

## That's also me 🤓
