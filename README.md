## Hey there 👋, I'm Makis!

> If I were to name a favorite book, that would be Gibson's "Neuromancer"; hackers jacking into cyberspace by projecting their consciousness into a shared virtual space, a hidden layer augmenting the perceived reality. That was cyberpunk at its most refined form; brains interfacing with computers and enhanced cognitive capabilities. Now I am positioned to realize the blur between science fiction and reality. Ideas and notions that were previously thought to be science fiction are becoming a reality, and that is something that overwhelms me.

> Quoting Gibson, "My problem is that all things are increasingly attractive to me". <br/>
> My unique interest and enthusiasm for Data Engineering (and ML as an afterthought) came organic from my previous professional experiences in SWE and my PhD research. Specifically, I tackled challenges related to analyzing big data in the latter one (Apache Spark enters the chat).

##### What's up?
👨‍💻 My current role is that of Senior Big Data Engineer (*DE*). <br />
🌍 Interested in green/energy tech and sustainability.


##### My professional skills and interests include
🐍 Python <br />
🚀 Scala <br />
🌊 DE — Azure/AWS and Databricks/Spark/SQL (batch & stream) <br />
🤖 MLE — k8s/kubeflow and Tensorflow <br />
🎯 Graph Theory <br />
❌ C++/Qt — not anymore


##### ... and messing around with
🧊 Engineering tools; Flink, Iceberg, Nessie, Datahub, etc.<br />
🦀 Languages such as Rust and Go.<br />
🕸️ Graph databases like neo4j.<br />


##### Academic background
🧠 PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University; focused on Brain Connectivity (functional) & Network Neuroscience.
> 💁 I did pursue a PhD in Cognitive Neuroscience (after 4+ years, countless hours of researching and publishing) just for fun and a hobby. I reached all the requirements to defend it but just I decided that I was not really interested in it anymore.
