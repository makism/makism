### Hi there 👋, it's me, Makis!

```
I've recently fell in love with mechanical keyboards.
    ⇲ Anne Pro 2 and the Granite keyset, designed by matt3o.
Also, according to my wife, I'm addicted to MOOCS — but I just enjoy leaning! 🤷‍♂️
```

I am a SWE & R&D (and data-curious) at [Brain Innovation B.V.](https://www.brainvoyager.com) in Maastricht, The Netherlands. At the same time I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Cognitive Neuroscience Department, in Maastricht University.

My interests and expertise include Brain Connectivity (functional) & Graph Theory (methods, algos), Python, C++/Qt, Data Engineering, Machine Learning and Real-Time Data Analytics. Also I'm a Go aficionado!

Oh, that's also me:<br/>
