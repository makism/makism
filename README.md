### Hi there 👋, i'm Makis!

```
I love mechanical keyboards, MOOCs and graph theory 🤷‍♂️
```

I am a SWE & R&D (and data-curious) at [Brain Innovation B.V.](https://www.brainvoyager.com) in Maastricht, The Netherlands. At the same time I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Cognitive Neuroscience Department, in Maastricht University.

Expert in Python, C++/Qt, with affinity for DS/DE and Real-Time Data Analytics. My research interests include Brain Connectivity (functional) & Graph Theory and Machine Learning.

As a proponent of lifelong learning, it is in my mindset to dedicate every day some time to obtain new knowledge. The topics that I am interested in include methodologies to improve my code skills (APIs, testing, design patterns, etc.), ML/DL, Statistics, Java or Go, etc.

Oh, that's also me:<br/>
