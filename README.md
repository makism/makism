### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, it's me, Makis!

```
I've recently fell in love with mechanical keyboards.
    â‡² Anne Pro 2 and the Granite keyset, designed by matt3o.
Also, according to my wife, I'm addicted to MOOCS â€” but I just enjoy leaning!

I am a Software Engineer at [Brain Innovation B.V.](https://www.brainvoyager.com) in Maastricht, The Netherlands. At the same time I am pursuing my Ph.D. degree in the Cognitive Neuroscience Department, in Maastricht University.

My interests and expertise include Brain Connectivity (functional) & Graph Theory (methods, algos), Python, C++/Qt, Machine Learning and Real-Time Big Data.

Oh, that's also me:<br/>
