## Hey there 👋, I'm Makis!

> If I were to name a favourite book, that would be Gibson's "Neuromancer"; hackers jacking into cyberspace by projecting their consciousness into a shared virtual space, a hidden layer augmenting the perceived reality. That was cyberpunk at its most refined form; brains interfacing with computers and enhanced cognitive capabilities. Now I am positioned to realize the blur between science fiction and reality. Ideas and notions that were previously thought to be science fiction are becoming a reality, and that is something that overwhelms me.

> Quoting Gibson, "My problem is that all things are increasingly attractive to me, " describes my engagement with computer science and neuroscience, studying the brain's cognition under different tasks, mental loads and even neurodegenerative diseases. More specifically, I am interested in investigating the connectivity between brain regions and studying graph theoretical analyses to explain these established networks. My most recent academic and professional choices are pivoted around these topics.

##### My professional skills and interests include
🐍 Python (I moved on from C++ long time ago :P) <br />
❄️ DE (AWS/Spark) and ML (kubeflow/Tensorflow)<br />
🍄 Graph Theory

##### Currently, I'm learning
🎯 Scala for FP<br />
🌊 Apache Kafka, Flink & Beam for Data Streaming<br/>
※ neo4j<br />
※ Julia

##### Academic background
※ PhD Candidate in Cognitive Neuroscience at Maastricht University; focused on Brain Connectivity (functional) & Network Neuroscience
