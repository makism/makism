## Hey there 👋, I'm Makis!

> If I were to name a favorite book, that would be Gibson's "Neuromancer"; hackers jacking into cyberspace by projecting their consciousness into a shared virtual space, a hidden layer augmenting the perceived reality. That was cyberpunk at its most refined form; brains interfacing with computers and enhanced cognitive capabilities. Now I am positioned to realize the blur between science fiction and reality. Ideas and notions that were previously thought to be science fiction are becoming a reality, and that is something that overwhelms me.

> Quoting Gibson, "My problem is that all things are increasingly attractive to me". <br/>
> My unique interest and enthusiasm for Data Engineering (and ML as an afterthought) came organic from my previous professional experiences in SWE and my PhD research. Specifically, I tackled challenges related to analyzing big data in the latter one (Apache Spark enters the chat).
